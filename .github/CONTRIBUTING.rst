Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``driven`` 
for local development.

1. Fork the ``driven`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/driven.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    mkvirtualenv driven
    cd driven/
    pip install -e .

4. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the quality 
control::

    tox

To get tox, just pip install it into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes using `semantic commit messages <https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages>`__ and push your branch to GitHub::

    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: your detailed description of your changes"
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request to this repository through the GitHub website.
