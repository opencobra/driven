Implementation of novel and state-of-the-art methods in order to integrate omics' data with genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models.

**Driven** is a high-level python library developed to integrate and
analyze *omics* data using constraint-based modeling. The library provides
state-of-the-art simulation methods, access to models and workflows to
easily analyze the most common data types.

Integration with **escher** allows quick visualization of results, comparison
between different conditions or methods.

Getting Started
===============

From a Python environment you can easily 

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install driven

.. summary-end

You can find the full documentation at https://driven.readthedocs.io.
